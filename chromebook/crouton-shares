# Defines directories to map into the chroot from the host.
# Order is important: be sure to mount directories before you mount
# subdirectories of those mounts.
# The only directories that can be mapped from outside of the chroot are
# subdirectories of the following locations:
#  downloads: ~/Downloads
#  shared: /mnt/stateful_partition/crouton/shared
#  encrypted: ~/crouton/shared
# Inside the chroot, any absolute or user-relative path (~/x or ~user/x) is OK.
# Syntax is as follows:
#  HOSTDIR CHROOTDIR [OPTIONS]
# Directory names can have spaces (if quoted), but no quote characters or
# relative path elements (..'s).
# Options can be any options to mount. If unspecified, "exec" is assumed.

# Examples:
#  Share a home directory encrypted by the current user's unsynced profile
#   encrypted/home ~
#  Share an unencrypted directory between chroots.
#   shared/home ~/Share
#  Absolute directories on the chroot side work too
#   shared/bin /usr/local/bin exec,suid
#  Share a noexec path that has spaces, and a specific user home directory
#   "encrypted/stupid example" "~omg/Why are you even doing this?" noexec

# Share the downloads folder of the current user's profile
downloads ~/.chromeos
